Supermarket Pricing:

I am so mad at myself after I had written so much for this and deleted when moving around my file in my repo. Here I go again. So, I initial attacked this from the point of view of the market manager and not a developer, I will try and adjust myself from my previous writing, but ill mostly keep the same since Amanda was ok with it. 

There are many questions that need to be answered to provide and accurate picture of what I may need to do to price product at this market. I will fist need to know all inventory available and what is on shelf and what is in the warehouse. Iâ€™ll also need to know about warehouse shipments, sale trends and product forecast. Ill need to see all current and past sales to establish a strategy to properly and accurately price products.

Another thing that I find important is understanding what is the max and min for profit margin and loss on investment the business can take. Taking in consideration what product sales most and which are moving slowly can be a useful tool to pricing. Take advantage of opportunities where I can hike prices and most commonly bought items to balance the losses taken from products that are not selling.
