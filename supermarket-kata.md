# Supermarket Pricing

## Problem Domain: Pricing goods at the supermarket

### Pricing questions:

#### 3 for a dollar
1) What's the price if I buy 3 or 4 or 6?


#### 1.99/pound
1) What would 2 oz cost?

#### buy two/get one free
1) What does the 3rd item have a price?
- the third item doesn't have a price, but it does have a cost.
- or it can have a hidden price since you're buying really buying three at a discounted price.


#### $20 off if you buy $50 or more
1) What if you buy $100? Is it now $40 off?

#### Buying Bulk: Buy 20 items for .50cents each or buy 10 items at $1ea
1) At what price does bulk buying become profitable?



### Problem domain questions to consider:

#### Does fractional money exist?
Fractional money does exist, it can be represented as percentages too!

#### When (if ever) does rounding take place?
IRounding may take place when you are buying in bulk or getting a deal.

#### How do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
It would help to keep a trail of pricing decisions to compare with other decisions on how well they performed.

#### Are costs and prices the same class of thing?
I think it depends on the use case.  If you are looking to find out profits then it could be useful to separate costs and price to compare them separetly. 

#### If a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?
The stock would have to be valued at the price of 3 cans.  Although you list it as getting one free, you are really buying three cans at a discounted price.
